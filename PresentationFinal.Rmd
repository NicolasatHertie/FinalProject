## Research Question & Motivation

**Research Question: Are community level factors significant determinants of HIV/AIDS incidence rates?**

1. Understand why some countries failed to achieve MDG 6A

- *MDG 6: "Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases"*

- *Target 6A: "Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS"*

2. Explore disease-specific determinants of health



## Theoretical Framework - Determinants of Health

![Figure1](http://www.publichealth.ie/sites/default/files/D-%26-W.jpg)


## Methodology

**Model**
$$ I_{it} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 SE_{it} + {\beta}_2 WLC_{it} + {\beta}_3 SCN_{it} + {\beta}_4 ILF_{it} + {\epsilon}_{it}$$

**Datasets**

- We will use the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the independent variables and a dataset from UNAIDS for the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.

**Methodology**

- Model 1: Logistic Regression & Predicted Probabilities
- Model 2: Pooled OLS Regression

# Creating the subset with countries above the mean with a loop for all 5 imputations
for (i in 1:5){
  Imputed2.out$imputations[[i]] <- Imputed2.out$imputations[[i]][which(Imputed.out$imputations[[i]]$Incidence>=0.07), ]
}
 
# Running a linear pooled OLS regression

## Conclusions & Limitations - Model 1

1. **Logistic Regression Results of Model 1 (all countries)**
- Generally in line with hypothesis
- Most of the variables are statistically significant
- Only Immunisation Variables and GDP per capital are not significant

2. **Predicted Probabilities of Model 1 (selected countries)**
- Direction of effect of Female School Enrollment matches initial assumptions for all case studies
- Direction of effect of Female Unemployment does not match initial assumptions for any case study

## Conclusions & Limitations - Model 2

3. **Linear Regression of Model 2 (countries with incidence above mean)**
- Significance of some variables changes
- Female School Enrollment and Female Unemployment remain highly significant
- Effect of Female School Enrollment becomes positive (!)

4. **Fixed Effects Regression of Model 2 (countries with incidence above mean)**
- Significance of some variables changes compared to simple linear model
- Female School Enrollment and Female Unemployment become insignificant
- Immunisation rates for DPT & Measles become highly significant (!)
