## Motivation and Research Question

1. Understand why some countries failed to achieve MDG 6A

- *MDG 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases*

- *Target 6A: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS*

2. Explore disease-specific determinants of health

**Research Question: Are community level factors significant determinants of HIV/AIDS incidence rates?**



## Literature Review

## The Model

To answer our research question we will estimate the following equation:

$$ I_{it} = {\beta}_0 +{\beta}_1 SE_{it} + {\beta}_2 WLC_{it} + {\beta}_3 SCN_{it} + {\beta}_4 ILF_{it} + {\epsilon}_{it}$$

Where I stands for HIV/AIDS incidence, SE stands for socioeconomic factors, WLC stands for working and living conditions, SCN stands for social and community networks and ILF stands for individual lifestyle factors. 

## Methodology and Dataset

**Methodology**

- We will...

**Datasets**

- We will use the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the independent variables and a dataset from UNAIDS for the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate. 

## Findings
